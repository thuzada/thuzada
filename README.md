Hi there! I'm Arthur Augusto, a Computer Science student at PUC Minas, aspiring backend programmer.

I'm constantly exploring new languages and concepts to create efficient and scalable solutions. Currently, I'm sharpening my skills in Java, Python, and SQL.

I'm eager to connect with fellow developers, collaborate on exciting projects, and contribute to the tech community.
